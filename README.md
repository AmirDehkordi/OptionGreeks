# Option Greeks: Calculation and Visualization in Python

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides an extensive introduction to option Greeks and demonstrates how to calculate and visualize them using Python.

## About the Notebook

Option Greeks are crucial measures in options trading, providing insights into how an option's price may change due to various underlying factors, such as changes in the underlying asset price, volatility, time to expiration, and interest rates. Understanding the behavior of option Greeks enables traders to make more informed decisions and manage their portfolio risk more effectively.

This notebook focuses on the most important option Greeks, namely Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho, Speed, Vega, Vomma, Charm, and Vanna. Each Greek is thoroughly explained, detailing how it works and its practical applications in trading. For each Greek, Python code is provided to calculate its value, and their behaviors are further visualized using 2D and 3D plots.

However, it's important to note that the notebook does not currently include the computation and visualization for Zomma, which is another commonly used Greek in some trading scenarios.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive introduction to key option Greeks.
- Python code snippets for calculating the values of each Greek.
- 2D and 3D visualization of the behaviors of option Greeks.
- Practical examples of how to incorporate option Greeks in trading strategies.

## Usage

To use this notebook, clone the repository and run the notebook in a Jupyter environment. Please ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. You may need to adjust the code examples based on your specific use case and data.
